## Objective
Our objective is to determine whether the lockdown that came into effect on 25th March, 2020 in India as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, made a difference to the overall pollution levels in the country. We have access to a large database containing pollution data dating from 1st January 2015 to 1st May 2020.


## Code and Resources used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly
* Data: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india

## Data Description
The dataset conatins 26219 rows containing daily entries for 12 different pollutants for 24 cities. It also contains the AQI and AQI Bucket values for each entry.

## Conclusion
* Using various visualization methods we can conclude that the overall pollution level in multiple cities across the country did decrease after the nationwide lockdown was enforced.
* We also witnessed certain trends with respect to the time of year, which govern the overall pollution concentrations in the country.
